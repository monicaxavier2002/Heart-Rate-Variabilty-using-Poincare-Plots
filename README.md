# Heart-Rate-Variabilty-using-Poincare-Plots

This repository is having all the codes used in the Mini Project during my Third year of Biomedical Engineering. The project is implemented in Python and we generate poincare plots and line plots from the ECG files in the form of text files. A Graphical user Interface (GUI) is developed in Python using Tkinter for HRV analysis and to process and display it in a simpler manner

***

## Installation

I have used Spyder IDE throughout the project. The following libraries need to installed:
'''
Python
pip install heartpy
pip install tkinter
'''

***

## More Information
I have used the HeartPy library available on:
[HeartPy - Python Heart Rate Analysis Toolkit](https://github.com/paulvangentcom/heartrate_analysis_python)

ECG data is obtained from:
[Physionet Database](https://archive.physionet.org/cd-updates/)
